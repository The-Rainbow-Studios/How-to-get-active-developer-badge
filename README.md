# Instructions

- Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, and create a new application on the account you want the badge on.
- Go to the bot tab and generate a bot account for the application.
- Click the "Reset Token" button to generate a token (if you have 2fa enabled, you'll need your code).
- Copy the token to your clipboard.
- Click this badge to clone this repo to a new repl in Replit -> [![Run on Repl.it](https://replit.com/badge/github/hackermondev/discord-active-developer-badge)](https://replit.com/new/github/The-Rainbow-Studios/How-to-get-active-developer-badge)
  - You will be redirected to Replit, you might have to create an account (you can Register with Google).
    - Replit is a website, and does not run off your computer! 
- Wait for the repo has finished cloning and the repl to fully connect.
- Click the green "Run" button at the top.
- Go to the console (big black square on the right) and paste in the token you copied earlier (**Note**: ``CTRL + V`` won't work, you'll need to do ``CTRL + Shift + V`` or right-click and click paste).
- Press the 'Enter' key.
- Wait for it to print 'DONE | Application/Bot is up and running. DO NOT CLOSE THIS TAB UNLESS YOU ARE FINISHED USING THE BOT, IT WILL PUT THE BOT OFFLINE.' in the console, **DON'T STOP THE PROGRAM OR CLOSE THE TAB YET OR THE BOT WILL CONSIDERED BY DISCORD AS 'UNRESPONSIVE'**
- Go back to the application page, go to the "General Information" tab, scroll down and copy application id.
- Create a new discord server (you can delete it at the end).
- Enable community on the server (you only need to do this if you don't own any other discord server with community enabled)
- Return back to https://discord.com/developers/applications.
- Copy the application id.
- Use this invite link to add the application to the server: (replace ``{applicationid}`` with what you copied) ``https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={applicationid}&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=105227086912``
- In the server, go to a channel and use the ``/ping`` command on the bot.
- Go to the <https://discord.com/developers/active-developer> page and register everything (**if it says you're not eligible, it's because you're not registered in their system yet. you might have to wait up to 24 hours**).
- Congrats on that shiny new badge.


**NOTE:** Make sure you have the “Use data to improve Discord” setting enabled under User Settings > Privacy & Safety otherwise you won't be able to be marked as eligible.

**NOTE 2:** You do not need to keep the Replit tab open 24/7. Only go to the Replit url whenever you want to run your bot.

If you're encountering any issues, join [this](https://api.tejas404.xyz/discord) server and ping me in the `#general` channel.
